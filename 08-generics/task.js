// Sure, here are ten advanced TypeScript questions focusing on generics, promises, asynchronous programming, and object-oriented programming:
const fetchWrapper = () => {
};
fetchWrapper();
// 4. **Async Iterator**:
//    Develop an asynchronous iterator that asynchronously fetches data from a remote source in chunks and iterates over the fetched data.
// 5. **Decorator Pattern**:
//    Implement the decorator pattern using TypeScript classes, where decorators can add behavior to methods or properties of a class dynamically.
// 6. **Type-safe Event Emitter**:
//    Design an event emitter class that ensures type safety for event names and data payloads using generics.
// 7. **Async Queue**:
//    Develop a queue data structure that processes items asynchronously in a first-in-first-out manner, ensuring that items are processed one at a time.
// 8. **Composition vs. Inheritance**:
//    Discuss the differences between composition and inheritance in object-oriented programming and provide scenarios where each approach is more suitable.
// 9. **Throttling Function**:
//    Create a throttling function that limits the rate at which a given function can be called, ensuring that it is not called more than once within a specified time interval.
// 10. **Generic Middleware Chain**:
//     Design a middleware chain system using generics, where each middleware function can modify the input data and pass it to the next middleware in the chain.
// These questions cover a range of topics in advanced TypeScript, including generics, promises, asynchronous programming, object-oriented design, and design patterns. They should provide a good challenge and opportunity for exploration in TypeScript developm
